What is redux and react-redux used for?

    - https://www.educba.com/what-is-redux/

    - Redux is an open-source JS library for managing application state.
    - Redux needs reducers to keep track of the actions.

    - Redux can also be considered as a middleware that deals with dispatching and reaching between actions and reducers.

What is axios used for?

    - we use axios to handle our http requests to the server
    - so, to get things from the server, post things, update, and delete things.

What is redux-thunk used for?

    - https://www.javatpoint.com/redux-thunk

    - "Since Redux's actions are asynchronously dispatched, two middleware libraries serve the purpose. They are Redux-Saga and Redux Thunk.
      Redux Thunk acts as a middleware that will return you a function instead of an object while calling through the action creators. 
      The returned function receives the dispatch method from the store and then later it is used to dispatch synchronously inside the body of function 
      once the asynchronous actions have been completed."
